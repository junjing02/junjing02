## Hi there, I'm JJ Ting

As a final-year Computer Science student at UTAR, I bring a hands-on, DIY mindset to every project, where I love building solutions and troubleshooting problems on my own before seeking help. I'm passionate about transforming innovative ideas into solutions that benefits both myself and the community. I'm seeking an internship during my final semester (27 Oct 2025 - 24 Jan 2026), after which I will graduate and be open to transitioning into a full-time role. I'm excited to apply my problem-solving enthusiasm and collaborative spirit to real-world challenges and continue growing as a developer.

- Internship Period:  27 Oct 2025 - 24 Jan 2026 (13 weeks)
- Expected Graduation: Jan 2026
